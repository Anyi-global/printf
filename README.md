PRINTF GROUP PROJECT

_printf
	A re-creation of the printf function in C!

NAME
       _Printf
SYNOPSIS
<hr>
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdarg.h>
	int _printf(const char *format, ...);
DESCRIPTION
<hr>
The function printf()produce output according to a format. The function printf()write output to the standard output stream;
this function write the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.

In between there may be (in this order) zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and an optional length modifier.

The overall syntax of a conversion specification is:

     %[flags][width][.precision][length modifier]conversion

The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier.  By default, the arguments are used in the order given, where each '*' (see Field width and Precision below) and each conversion specifier asks for the next argument (and it is an error if insufficiently many arguments are given). One can also specify explicitly which argument is taken, at each place where an argument is required, by writing "%m" instead of '%' and "*m" instead of '*', where the decimal integer m denotes the position in the argument list of the desired argument, indexed starting from 1.  Thus,

           printf("%*d", width, num);

			    and

           printf("%2*1d", width, num);

are equivalent.  The second style allows repeated references to the same argument.  The C99 standard does not include the style



Flag characters
The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:

#      The value should be converted to an "alternate form". For
       o conversions, the first character of the output string is
       made zero (by prefixing a 0 if it was not zero already).
       For x and X conversions, a nonzero result has the string
       "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions) prepended to it.  For a,
       A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, the result will
       always contain a decimal point, even if no digits follow
       it (normally, a decimal point appears in the results of
       those conversions only if a digit follows).  For g and G
       conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the
       result as they would otherwise be.  For other conversions,
       the result is undefined.

0      The value should be zero padded.  For d, i, o, u, x, X, a,
       A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, the converted value
       is padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks.  If
       the 0 and - flags both appear, the 0 flag is ignored.  If
       a precision is given with a numeric conversion (d, i, o,
       u, x, and X), the 0 flag is ignored.  For other
       conversions, the behavior is undefined.

 -      The converted value is to be left adjusted on the field
       boundary.(The default is right justification.)  The
       converted value is padded on the right with blanks, rather
       than on the left with blanks or zeros.  A - overrides a 0
       if both are given.

' '     (a space) A blank should be left before a positive number
       (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.

+       A sign (+ or -) should always be placed before a number
       produced by a signed conversion.  By default, a sign is
       used only for negative numbers.  A + overrides a space if
       both are used.

The five flag characters above are defined in the C99 standard.
The Single UNIX Specification specifies one further flag character.

 '      For decimal conversion (i, d, u, f, F, g, G) the output is
       to be grouped with thousands' grouping characters if the
       locale information indicates any


I      For decimal integer conversion (i, d, u) the output uses
       the locale's alternative output digits, if any.

Field width
  An optional decimal digit string (with nonzero first digit)
  specifying a minimum field width. If the converted value has
  fewer characters than the field width, it will be padded with
  spaces on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
  been given).Instead of a decimal digit string one may write"*"
  or "*m" (for some decimal integer m) to specify that the field
  width is given in the next argument, or in the m-th argument,
  respectively, which must be of type int. A negative fieldwidth
 is taken as a '-' flag followed by a positive field width. In no
 case does a nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of
 a field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field
 width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion result.

Precision
 An optional precision, in the form of a period('.')followedby
 an optional decimal digit string.  Instead of a decimal digit
 string one may write "*" or "*m" (for some decimal integer m) to
 specify that the precision is given in the next argument, or in
 the m-th argument, respectively, which must be of type int.  If
 the precision is given as just '.', the precision is taken to be
 zero. A negative precision is taken as if the precision were
 omitted. This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
 d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, the number of digits to appear
 after the radix character for a, A, e, E, f, and F conversions,
 the maximum number of significant digits for g and G conversions,
 or the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string
 for s and S conversions.

Length modifier
 Here, "integer conversion" stands for d, i, o, u, x, or X
 conversion.

 h      A following integer conversion corresponds to a short or
        unsigned short argument, or a following n conversion
        corresponds to a pointer to a short argument.

 l     (ell) A following integer conversion corresponds to a long
        or unsigned long argument, or a following n conversion
        corresponds to a pointer to a long argument, or a
        following c conversion corresponds to a wint_t argument,
        or a following s conversion corresponds to a pointer to
        wchar_t argument.

Conversion specifiers
  A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
  The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

d, i     The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
        The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits
        that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer
        digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.  The default
        precision is 1.  When 0 is printed with an explicit
        precision 0, the output is empty.

o, u, x, X
        The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal
        (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and
        X) notation.  The letters abcdef are used for x
        conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X
        conversions.  The precision, if any, gives the minimum
        number of digits that must appear; if the converted value
        requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with
        zeros.  The default precision is 1.  When 0 is printed
        with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

e, E     The double argument is rounded and converted in the style
       [-]d.dddeÂ±dd where there is one digit (which is nonzero if
        the argument is nonzero) before the decimal-point
        character and the number of digits after it is equal to
       the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken as
        6; if the precision is zero, no decimal-point character
        appears.  An E conversion uses the letter E (rather than
        e) to introduce the exponent.  The exponent always
        contains at least two digits; if the value is zero, the
        exponent is 00.

f, F    The double argument is rounded and converted to decimal
        notation in the style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of
        digits after the decimal-point character is equal to the
        precision specification.  If the precision is missing, it
        is taken as 6; if the precision is explicitly zero, no
        decimal-point character appears.  If a decimal point
        appears, at least one digit appears before it.

c        If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted
        to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is
        written.  If an l modifier is present, the wint_t (wide
        character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence
        by a call to the wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion
        state starting in the initial state, and the resulting
        multibyte string is written.

s      If no l modifier is present: the const char * argument is
       expected to be a pointer to an array of character type
       (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are
       written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte
       ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than the
       number specified are written.  If a precision is given, no
       null byte need be present; if the precision is not
       specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the
       array must contain a terminating null byte.

       If an l modifier is present: the const wchar_t * argument
       is expected to be a pointer to an array of wide
       characters.  Wide characters from the array are converted
       to multibyte characters (each by a call to the wcrtomb(3)
       function, with a conversion state starting in the initial
       state before the first wide character), up to and
       including a terminating null wide character.  The
       resulting multibyte characters are written up to (but not
       including) the terminating null byte.  If a precision is
       specified, no more bytes than the number specified are
       written, but no partial multibyte characters are written.
       Note that the precision determines the number of bytes
       written, not the number of wide characters or screen
       positions.  The array must contain a terminating null wide
       character, unless a precision is given and it is so small
       that the number of bytes written exceeds it before the end
       of the array is reached.

 p      The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal (as
       if by %#x or %#lx).

n      The number of characters written so far is stored into the
       integer pointed to by the corresponding argument.  That
       argument shall be an int *, or variant whose size matches
       the (optionally) supplied integer length modifier.  No
       argument is converted.  (This specifier is not supported
       by the bionic C library.)  The behavior is undefined if
       the conversion specification includes any flags, a field
       width, or a precision.

 %      A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete
       conversion specification is '%%'.
RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, this function return the number of
characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to
strings).If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
